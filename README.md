# MetronomeApp
This app is a "hobby" project to familiarize myself with the Pyside6 GUI framework and to learn how to combine multimedia elements (sounds & visuals) with an SQLite database backend functionality. Features will be added when I have time. I intend to use the app for practicing songs for my band as well as to establish a practicing routine.
